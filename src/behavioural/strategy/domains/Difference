Comparision of Structural Pattern

Structural Pattern uses Composition over Inheritance
=======================================================   


Adapter:
- Class adapter and object Adapter
- java uses only object adapter
- uses composition over inheritance
- two unrelated objects are made to work together
- changes the objects interface 
Example: Arrays.asList(), InputStreamReader



Decorator:
- adds/changes responsibility dynamically
- more than one decorators can be used
Example: java.io.Classes - ObjectOutputStream(FileOutputStream(File))



Facade:
- one entry point or a single interface through which a group of objects  are Accessed
- make an entry point subsystems
- subsystems are not aware of the Facade
Example:  ExternalContext as in JSF, pageContext as JEE, $.ajax as in jquery



Proxy:

- controlled Access
- Stand in for a Complex Object
- Proxies are created from Interfaces
Example: RMI - Stubs



Composite:
- Tree like Structure
- many leaves
- composite holds the leaves
- used for recursion
Example: addAll(Collection), Map.putAll(Map) 



Bridge:
- Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently
- two different hierarchy
